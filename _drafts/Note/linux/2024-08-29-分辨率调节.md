# 如何更改vnc分辨率

If the 2560x1600 resolution is not available in XFCE4's display settings, you can try adding it manually using the `xrandr` command. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Check Available Resolutions:**
   Open a terminal and type the following command to list all available resolutions:
   ```bash
   xrandr
   ```

2. **Add the Desired Resolution:**
   If 2560x1600 is not listed, you can add it manually by following these steps:

   1. Generate a new mode using `cvt` (for 2560x1600 at 60Hz):
      ```bash
      cvt 2560 1600 60
      ```
      This will output something like:
      ```bash
      # 2560x1600 59.97 Hz (CVT) hsync: 97.76 kHz; pclk: 268.50 MHz
      Modeline "2560x1600_60.00"  268.50  2560 2752 3024 3488  1600 1603 1609 1646 -hsync +vsync
      ```

   2. Use the `Modeline` from the previous output to create a new mode:
      ```bash
      xrandr --newmode "2560x1600_60.00"  268.50  2560 2752 3024 3488  1600 1603 1609 1646 -hsync +vsync
      ```

   3. Add the new mode to your display:
      First, identify the name of your display (e.g., `HDMI-1`, `eDP-1`) using `xrandr`.
      Then, add the mode to your display:
      ```bash
      xrandr --addmode <your-display-name> 2560x1600_60.00
      ```

3. **Apply the New Resolution:**
   Now you can switch to the new resolution:
   ```bash
   xrandr --output <your-display-name> --mode --mode 2560x1600_60.00
   ```

If everything works as expected, you can make this change permanent by adding the commands to your `.xprofile` or a startup script.

## rc（termux环境）

It looks like you're working within a Termux environment, which doesn’t include traditional system utilities like `systemctl` because Termux doesn't manage services the same way a typical Linux distribution does. Instead, Termux is more of a user-space environment without a full init system.

### Identifying the Environment
Given that you're using Termux, it's highly likely that you are not using a traditional display manager like LightDM, GDM, or SDDM. Instead, you might be starting your X session manually or through some custom script.

### What to Do Next:

#### 1. **Starting the X Session Manually:**
If you're starting your X session manually (e.g., with `startx`), you'll need to configure your display settings in a different file, such as `.xinitrc`.

Here's how you can create and use an `.xinitrc` file:

1. **Create `.xinitrc`:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/.xinitrc
   ```

2. **Add Commands to Set the Display Resolution:**
   Add your `xrandr` commands directly to this file:

   ```bash
   # Add the new mode
   xrandr --newmode "2560x1600_60.00" 348.50 2560 2760 3032 3504 1600 1603 1609 1658 -hsync +vsync

   # Add the mode to your display
   xrandr --addmode VNC-0 2560x1600_60.00

   # Set the mode for your display
   xrandr --output VNC-0 --mode 2560x1600_60.00

   # Start your window manager or desktop environment
   startxfce4
   ```

3. **Make It Executable (if needed):**
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.xinitrc
   ```

4. **Start X Session:**
   If you’re using `startx`, this will now execute the commands in `.xinitrc`.

   ```bash
   startx
   ```

#### 2. **Using a Different Method to Manage X Sessions:**
If you're using something else to manage your X sessions, you might need to adjust where you place your configuration scripts.

### Conclusion:
In a Termux environment, where a traditional display manager isn't available, using `.xinitrc` or placing commands in a relevant shell startup script (like `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or a custom Termux-specific script) is the way to go. This allows you to configure your X session settings manually.

## rc （普通环境）



If you can't find an `.xprofile` file, it's likely that it hasn't been created yet. You can create one yourself to store custom display settings or any commands you want to run when your X session starts. Here’s how you can create and use the `.xprofile` file:

### Steps to Create and Use `.xprofile`

1. **Create the `.xprofile` File:**
   Open a terminal and run the following command to create a `.xprofile` file in your home directory:

   ```bash
   touch ~/.xprofile
   ```

2. **Edit the `.xprofile` File:**
   Use your preferred text editor to open and edit the file:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.xprofile
   ```

   If you're using `nano`, you can also use `vim`, `gedit`, or any other editor.

3. **Add Your Display Settings:**
   Add the `xrandr` commands you used earlier to set the resolution. For example:

   ```bash
   # Add a new mode
   xrandr --newmode "2560x1600_60.00" 348.50 2560 2760 3032 3504 1600 1603 1609 1658 -hsync +vsync

   # Add the mode to your display
   xrandr --addmode VNC-0 2560x1600_60.00

   # Set the mode for your display
   xrandr --output VNC-0 --mode 2560x1600_60.00
   ```

4. **Save and Exit:**
   If you're using `nano`, press `Ctrl + O` to save, then `Ctrl + X` to exit.

5. **Make the `.xprofile` Executable (Optional):**
   This step isn't usually necessary, but to ensure the file can be executed, you can change its permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.xprofile
   ```

### Applying Changes
The commands in `.xprofile` will be executed automatically the next time you log in or start an X session. If you want to test it immediately without logging out, you can source the file:

```bash
source ~/.xprofile
```

Now your display settings should be applied every time you start XFCE4.
